## 📂 Description

Build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that can answer questions about a codebase that will:
- Get the `vLLM` repository *(available in the project page on the intra)* and create a searchable knowledge base
- Search this knowledge base to find relevant code snippets and documentation for given questions
- Answer questions using an LLM with the retrieved context
- Evaluate your retriaval system's quality using recall@k metrics

### 🤖 What is a RAG

When creating an AI model, the first steps is to train it. There are two technique **Training** when the AI is fed with a huge amount of data. The LLM then remembers what it has leaderned but only knows the data it has been given. The other technique is **RAG**. Instead of feeding the model data directly, RAG gives the model access to an external source of information. Of course, the two techniques can be combined.
And a RAG have three key concepts:
- **Indexing**: the data is indexed, this step structures and organises the information to make it searchable later on.
- **Retrieving**: the model need to understand the question to search the database to retrieve the most useful snippets. Once done, it matches the query with the indexed database to choose the best results and pulls out the most relevant pieces of information.
- **Augmenting**: it can combine the retrieved information with its knowledge. However, we try to realy as much as possible on the retrieved data rather than the model's internal knowledge since mixing both may lead to outdated or hallucinatory answers. Starting from the retrieved results, the best thing to do is to clean and filter the retrieved information to remove irrelevant snippets and, then, insert into the context window.
- **Generating**: the final goal is the generate an answer. The AI will reads the context window, understands the task at hand, blends the knowledge, and generates the output.

### 📝 Rules:

- Use the model **Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B* or any other models as long as it is working with the first one.
- **uv** must be used as project and package manager.
- The system must providea **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** using Python Fire.
- Progress bars should be implemented for long-running operations using `tqdm`.

## 💡 Instructions

To launch the RAG, you'll need a dataset and the vlmm available on the 42 intranet (alternatively, you can create your own dataset):
- Dataset go in *data/datasets*
- vllm can be a archive in the root, or a folder in *data/raw*

⚠️ Arguments are optionals

First, you need to index the dataset:
```bash
uv run python -m src index --max_chunk_size
  or
make index max_chunk_size=
```

Then, you retrieve the best k-documents among the given dataset:
```bash
uv run python -m search_dataset --dataset_path --k --save_directory
  or
make search_dataset dataset_path= k= save_directory=
```

You can also retrieve the best k-documents for a simple question:
```bash
uv run python -m search --query --k
  or
make search query= k=
```

Finally, ask the LLM to answers the questions for a dataset:
```bash
uv run python -m answer_dataset --student_search_results --save_directory --context_limit
  or
make answer_dataset student_search_results= save_directory= context_limit=
```

Or ask for a simple question:
```bash
uv run python -m answer --query --k --context_limit
  or
make answer query= k= context_limit=
```

You can evaluate a dataset with a custom recall:
```bash
uv run python -m evaluate --student_search_results_path --dataset_path
  or
make evaluate student_search_results_path= dataset_path=
```

## ⚙️ How it works?

The program reads and chunks the corpus from the target repository, creates an optimized index, retrieves the top-$k$ relevant source snippets for incoming questions, and uses an autoregressive model to produce grounded answers.

### 🧩 System architecture

The application is structured into four decoupled pipeline layers:

1. **Chunking (`ChunkerEngine`)**: Ingests repository files and divides them into fixed segments while tracking exact document character offsets (`first_character_index`, `last_character_index`).
2. **Indexing (`indexer`)**: Serializes chunk text and metadata into a local JSON store, then tokenizes and builds a persistent BM25 index using English stemming.
3. **Retrieving (`RetrieverEngine`)**: Tokenizes input queries with the same stemming pipeline, evaluates query term frequency across the indexed documents, and pulls the top-$k$ highest-scoring chunks.
4. **Generation (`AnswerEngine`)**: Packs retrieved chunks into a system prompt, truncates the prompt to respect context boundaries, and runs batch inference with Hugging Face's text generation pipeline.

### 🗿 Chunking Strategy

Standard character-count splitting often breaks semantic context across syntax elements. The chunking layer uses specialized splitters depending on file formats:

- **Python (`.py`)**: Uses `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_language(Language.PYTHON)` with `chunk_overlap = 100`. This aligns split boundaries with language syntax (functions, classes, docstrings) while maintaining structural context across chunks.
- **Documentation (`.md`, `.txt`)**: Uses markdown-aware recursive splitting to keep headers, sections, and paragraphs intact, coupled with an overlap to avoid losing keywords that land on chunk boundaries.
- **Precise Offset Calculation**: Unlike naive character searches that fail when repetitive syntax blocks occur, offsets are computed sequentially using relative cursors to guarantee exact character ranges in evaluation metadata.

### 🥊 Retrieval method

The engine uses **`bm25s`**, an optimized implementation of the BM25 probabilistic relevance algorithm:

- **Stemming & Normalization**: Text is stemmed with `PyStemmer` (Snowball English) and filtered against English stopwords, matching morphologically related tokens (e.g., `retrieves`, `retrieval`, `retrieved`).
- **Memory & Storage Decoupling**: Document metadata and raw text are stored in a dedicated JSON database (`chunks_db.json`), while the BM25 inverted index only holds sparse token matrices to ensure lightweight loading during evaluation runs.
- **Scoring & Ranking**: The retriever calculates matching scores across chunks and outputs sorted `ChunkSearchResult` objects containing both the relevance score and document bounds.

### 📈 Performance analysis

Benchmark results obtained during the evaluation suite (tested on Ubuntu Linux):

- **Indexing**: ~8s for the complete corpus (far below the 300s upper limit).
- **Retrieval Speed**: 200 questions retrieved in ~8s across docs and code (threshold: <= 90s).
- **Retrieval Recall**:
  - **Docs Recall@5**: ~80% (passes the 0.80 target).
  - **Code Recall@5**: ~58% (passes the 0.50 target).
- **Batch Inference**: Grouping dataset evaluation queries into batches (`batch_size = 4`) maximizes GPU/VRAM utilization and reduces overall generation runtime.

### 📠 Design decisions

- **BM25 over Dense Embeddings**: High-dimensional neural embeddings (e.g., BERT, text-embedding-ada) require heavier dependencies and GPU overhead. Pure BM25 with stemming meets throughput limits (warm search under 90s) while keeping recall competitive on code syntax and technical documentation.
- **Pydantic Validation**: Strict schema enforcement (`MinimalSource`, `MinimalAnswer`, `StudentSearchResults`) guarantees input and output files conform to the project evaluation specifications.
- **Sub-string Artifact Stripping**: Generation prompts append `/no_think` and run-time post-processing strips `<think>...</think>` tags to prevent reasoning leakage when interacting with distilled reasoning models.

### 🏆 Challenges faced

- **Beginning of the project**: Knowing what to do first, where to go.
- **LLM creating**: Creating the LLM and using the Hugging Face pipelines.
- **Strict Typing with ML Libraries**: Hugging Face pipelines produce dynamic dictionary and nested list returns. Ensuring full `mypy --strict` compliance required defensive type assertions on pipeline tokenizers and explicit signature conversions across generation helpers.
- **Recall Boundary Losses**: Early indexing passes using `chunk_overlap = 0` cut technical concepts across split boundaries, dropping Recall@5 on text documentation. Introducing targeted overlaps and monotonic index stepping resolved the edge-case drops.

### 🗨 Example usage

#### 1. Indexing the corpus
```bash
uv run python -m src index --max_chunk_size=600
```

#### 2. Retrieving chunks for a single query
```bash
uv run python -m src search --query="How does the attention mask work in vLLM?" --k=5
```

#### 3. Generating an answer from retrieved sources
```bash
uv run python -m src answer --query="How does the attention mask work in vLLM?" --k=3 --context_limit=2048
```

#### 4. Running full pipeline on a dataset
```bash
uv run python -m src answer_dataset \
  --student_search_results="data/evaluations/search_results.json" \
  --save_directory="data/evaluations/answers/" \
  --context_limit=2048
```
